To place obstacles (collisions), we could implement basic logic checks.  
This is a complex task in gaming, but here we could use a simple verification if the tile we are stepping into are blocked to be used.  
To accomplish this we would need to use another array which would be used to mark which tiles are blocked.  

Here we would like to assign tiles which cannot be passed through.  
Usually this achieved by game engines, using collision detection, but we could write a simple logic which would allow us to detect the next tile character moves to.  
First we need to come up with tile numbers character cannot surpass:



```javascript
let blockers = [61, 62, 63]

class Player {
  constructor(){
      this.size = 18;
      this.x = 0;
      this.y = 0;
  }
  draw(){
    push();
    fill('#222222');
    rect(this.x,this.y,this.size,this.size);
    pop();
  }

  move(x,y){
    let block = Math.floor((this.x+x) / 18) + (Math.floor((this.y+y) / 14) * 9);
    if (!blockers.includes(map[block])) {
      this.x += x;
      this.y += y;
    }
  }
}
```
