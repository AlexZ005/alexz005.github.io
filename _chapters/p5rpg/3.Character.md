Now once we know how to start, let us repeat everything again. Because we learn faster by repeating.  

We are creating index.html file, but this time we could use VSCode.  
Build in functionality called Emmet, by typing exclamation mark.  

This will generate html code if a file have an .html extension.

1. On p5js.org website, click P5 editor
2. Copy p5.js line number 4 and 
3. Once this is done, the only thing left is to copy sketch.js contents where we have only setup and draw functions.

We need to draw a drawGrid, we could use our belowed square for this.  
Lets remove an animation we have made and create a new function, we can choose a name.  
drawGrid function would be used place the rectangle and draw function, square appears.  
  

We would use the following block to draw rectangles:  

```javascript
function drawGrid() {
  // for (j=0; j<5;j++){
    // for (i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
    rect(30, 20, 55, 55);
    //}
  // }

}
```

To draw one rectangle we could use rect function:  

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-preview-width="600" data-height="600">

function setup() {
createCanvas(400,400);
//for (i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
rect(55, 20, 55, 55);
//}
}

</script>

This could be made in a loop to draw one line of rectangles:  

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-preview-width="600" data-height="600">

function setup() {
createCanvas(400,400);
  for (i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
    rect(i*55, 20, 55, 55);
  }
}

</script>

The second loop would allow us to draw multiple lines with those rectangles:  

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-preview-width="600" data-height="600">
function setup() {
createCanvas(400,400);
  for (j=0; j<5;j++){
    for (i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
       rect(i*55, j*55, 55, 55);
    }
  }
}
</script>

After preparing a grid, we could place a new class which would define our player, this would be another rectangle drawn on top of the grid:  

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay data-preview-width="600" data-height="600">
function setup() {
  createCanvas(400, 400);
  player = new Player();
}

class Player {
    constructor(){
        this.x = 0;
        this.y = 0;
    }
    draw(){
      fill('#222222')
      rect(this.x,this.y,16,16)
    }
    move(x,y){
        this.x += x;
        this.y += y;
    }
}

function draw() {
    background(220);
    drawGrid();
    player.draw();
}

function drawGrid() {
  for (j=0; j<5;j++){
    for (i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
    rect(i*55, j*55, 55, 55);
    }
  }
}


</script>

        this.y += y;

    player.draw();

    for (i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
    rect(i*55, j*55, 55, 55);
    }
  }
}

function keyPressed(){
  if (keyCode === UP_ARROW){
      player.move(0,-55);
  }
  if (keyCode === DOWN_ARROW){
    player.move(0,55);
  }
  if (keyCode === LEFT_ARROW){
      player.move(-55,0);
  }
  if (keyCode === RIGHT_ARROW){
    player.move(55,0);
  }
}
