Now once we know how to start, let us repeat everything again. Because we learn faster by repeating.  

We are creating index.html file, but this time we could use VSCode.  
Build in functionality called Emmet, by typing exclamation mark.  

This will generate html code if a file have an .html extension.

1. On p5js.org website, click P5 editor
2. Copy p5.js line number 4 and 
3. Once this is done, the only thing left is to copy sketch.js contents where we have only setup and draw functions.

We need to draw a drawGrid, we could use our belowed square for this.  
Lets remove an animation we have made and create a new function, we can choose a name.  
drawGrid function would be used place the rectangle and draw function, square appears.  
  
```javascript
function drawGrid() {
  // for (j=0; j<5;j++){
    // for (i = 0; i < 9; i++) {
    rect(30, 20, 55, 55);
    //}
  // }

}
```

Example widget:  

<script type="text/p5" data-autoplay>
function setup() {
  createCanvas(100, 100);
  background(255, 0, 200);
}
</script>
